ideas
- add subcode support to other functions where it makes sense (eg. count)
- interleave rank/plain blocks in BitVector
- interleave rank/plain blocks and fetch both at once as u64 in CBitVector
- add groupBits suppoert where it makes sense
- add alpha-majority functionality (query evenly-spaced quantiles)
- more bitvector tests
	- large vectors
	- dense vs sparse patterns
	- clusters of various shapes
	- large empty vectors
	- add same one bit multiple times
	- add one bits out of order
	- verify zero-compression space savings
- multiset tests
	- RankMultiSet
	- AccessMultiSet
- wavelet matrix tests
