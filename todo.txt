ideas
- add subcode support to other functions where it makes sense (eg. count)
	- countSymbolBatch
		- need to think about how subcodes interact with our strategy of
		  going through the sorted symbol list once per level (subcodes aren't
		  globally sorted; only sorted within their preceding subcode bit prefix.
		- i think we need different subcode ranges specified separately; would be nice
		  if some can be specified as (lo, hi) and others as arrays, so we can do
		  combination range and batch queries. (could specify global (lower, upper)
		  and also specific batch overrides per level, making this an extension of
		  counts.
		- see if this can be simplified.
- add groupBits support where it makes sense
- add alpha-majority functionality (query evenly-spaced quantiles)
- more bitvector tests
	- large vectors
	- dense vs sparse patterns
	- clusters of various shapes
	- large empty vectors
	- add same one bit multiple times
	- add one bits out of order
	- verify zero-compression space savings
- multiset tests
	- RankMultiSet
	- AccessMultiSet
	- can we make a single (configurable) multiset now that we have rank/select for 1 and 0 on the plain vec?
- wavelet matrix tests
- figure out the scratch space story; bump allocator?
- bitvcetor
	- store only one of maxOnesIndex / storedLength; the latter is former plus 1
	- only resize down in finish if the smaller size is eg. 90% of the larger size
	- interleave rank/plain blocks in BitVector
	- interleave rank/plain blocks and fetch both at once as u64 in CBitVector
- wavelet matrix
	- explore keeping an associated weight vector (RankMultiSet) in order to support weighted quantiles, counts, etc.
